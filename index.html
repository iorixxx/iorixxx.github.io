        <p>I am a senior search architect with over eight years of hands-on experience in <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Lucene/Solr</a> and related technologies. I took leading search architect role in several Apache Lucene/Solr projects in Turkey including:</p>

<ul>
<li>a leading e-commerce company</li>
<li>an online retail company</li>
<li>an online legal search engine for legal and law related documents</li>
<li>an enterprise search application for call center employees</li>
<li>an online food ordering portal</li>
</ul>

<p>The experiences I have acquired during the projects combined with my solid academic background on the field become the personal asset that I rely on the most: my ability to combine theory and practice.</p>

<p>I am a committer and Project Management Committee member at The Apache Software Foundation. As someone who believes in open source, I am enthusiastic to help organizations and companies to migrate from proprietary software to its open-source counterpart.</p>

<p>Ahmet Arslan has been working at <a href="https://akademik.eskisehir.edu.tr/aarslan2">Anadolu University</a> since December 2004. He was promoted from Research Assistant to Assistant Professor in January, 2017.
He is the Head of the Department of Computer Engineering at Eskisehir Technical University.
